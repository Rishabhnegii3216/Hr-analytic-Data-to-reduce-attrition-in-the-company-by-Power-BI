# Power BI Project - Superstore Retail Business Analysis
## Overview
ðŸ“Š Just submitted my Power BI project based on the analysis of a superstore retail business. ðŸ’¼ðŸ›’OdinSchool In this project, I delved into the world of data operations, extraction, cleaning, and transformation. It was all about converting raw data into actionable insights. ðŸ“¦ðŸ’¡ Here are some key highlights:

## Key Highlights
### Data Extraction and Cleaning
1. Extracted data directly from Excel files for user-friendly access.
2. Cleaned and prepared the dataset by deleting empty columns and rows, changing data types, and splitting and renaming fields.
3. Standardized values in the Ship Mode column for consistency.
4. Split the address column into City, State, Country, and Pincode for better analysis.

### Data Modeling
1. Converted a flat file into a STAR schema to enhance analysis performance.
2. Created a central Fact table, 'Orders,' and three dimension tables: 'Order details,' 'Customer,' and 'Product.'
3. Ensured one-to-many relationships between dimensions and the fact table.

### Data Analysis
1. Calculated Sales and created a card visual to display total sales.
2. Analyzed sales from discounted products and displayed the total sales from them.
3. Created a 'Cart Value' column to categorize order values as Low, Medium, High, or Very High.
4. Visualized total sales from the Low Cart category.
5. Used card visuals to track sales from the Low Cart category with a discount of 50% or more.
6. Calculated the number of days it takes to deliver for each shipment type and created a column chart.
7. Visualized sales trends for special occasions like festivals using a matrix visualization.
8. Visualized cumulative sales for each month across all years to calculate Year-on-Year Sales Growth.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/RavinaKarnik/Superstore-Retail-Business
2. Open the Excel files in Microsoft Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software.
3. Navigate to the respective reports to access the analysis and insights.
